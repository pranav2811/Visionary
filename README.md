## Features

- **Image Captioning**: Generate accurate captions for images.
- **Visual Question Answering**: Answer questions related to the content of an image.
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Produce comprehensive narratives about visual inputs.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly CLI and potential GUI support.

## How It Works

Visionary integrates two powerful AI models:

- **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training)**: A model that excels in understanding and interpreting images.
- **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)**: An advanced language model that generates coherent and contextually relevant text.

By combining BLIP's image analysis capabilities with LLaMA's text generation prowess, Visionary delivers in-depth visual content analysis.
